Plan:

### Game Summary:  
In this game, players control a "snake" represented by a chain of 13 beads plus a head. The beads start out translucent, and the primary objective is to navigate the board to collect opaque beads while avoiding collisions with other chains. The game is set on a top-down, semi-opaque pseudo-3D board with a marble texture, creating an immersive visual experience enhanced by particle effects and drifting clouds.

### Gameplay Logic:
1. **Snake Chain Mechanics:**
   - **Initial State:** Each snake starts with 13 translucent beads and a head.
   - **Becoming Opaque:** When another snake crosses the player’s path, one of the player’s translucent beads becomes opaque.
   - **Full Chain Effect:** Once the player’s snake has 13 opaque beads, all beads start glowing, and the snake's speed increases. At this stage, any other snake that crosses the player's path loses all its opaque beads.
   - **Gold Beads:** When the player destroys another snake, a gold bead is added to the head of the player’s snake. The destroyed snake loses all its beads (opaque and translucent), and the gold beads are scattered on the board, available for collection.

2. **Board and Environment:**
   - **Visuals:** The board has a top-down view with a semi-opaque pseudo-3D appearance, featuring a marble texture.
   - **Particle Effects:** Clouds of particles drift across the board, adding a dynamic element to the environment.
   - **Falling Beads:** When a chain is destroyed, its beads fall through the board, creating a visually striking effect.

3. **Scoring and Objectives:**
   - **Collect Beads:** The main goal is to collect as many opaque and gold beads as possible while avoiding losing your own. Collect an opaque bead if a snake crosses your path while your chain is still translucent
   - **Defeat Opponents:** Destroy other snakes by making them run into you when you have a glowing, full chain of opaque beads.

4. **AI and Multiplayer:**
   - **Single-Player Mode:** The initial version will feature one player and simple AI-controlled snakes that follow random movement patterns.
   - **Multiplayer Extension:** The game is designed with future expansion in mind, allowing for potential multiplayer gameplay where multiple players can compete against each other in real-time.

### Graphic Look:
- The game will feature a **top-down view** on a **semi-opaque pseudo-3D board** with a **marble texture**.
- **Snakes** are composed of **chains of beads**, which change in appearance (from translucent to opaque to glowing) based on game events.
- **Particle effects** and **drifting clouds** will add atmosphere and dynamic visual interest to the board.
- **Falling beads** and **gold bead collections** will provide additional visual feedback during gameplay.
